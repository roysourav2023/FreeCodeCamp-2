                    The famous historian Edward Gibbon wrote that under
                    <a id = "tribute-link" target = "_blank" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>,the last of the 
                    ‘Five Good Emperors,’ “the Roman Empire was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of wisdom and virtue”. 
                    The guidance of wisdom and virtue. 
                    That’s what separates Marcus from the majority of past and present world leaders.
                    Just think of the diary that he left 
                    behind, which is now known as his Meditations which we discuss below: the private thoughts of the 
                    most powerful man in the 
                    world, admonishing himself on how to be more virtuous, more just, more immune to temptation, wiser.

                    And for Marcus, Stoicism provided a framework for dealing with the stresses of daily life 
                    as a leader of one of the most 
                    powerful empires in human history. It is not surprising that he wrote his Meditations in the last decade of his life, 
                    while on campaigning against foreign invaders. Passed down from his mentors and teachers,
                    <i>Marcus</i> embraced the studies of 
                    Stoicism which we see in him thanking his teacher Rusticus for introducing him to Stoicism and Epictetus inside Meditations. 
                    Another influence on Marcus came from Heraclitus, whose concepts we can see throughout Meditations and who had a strong 
                    influence on Stoic thought. Given the literary world at the time, Marcus was mostly likely not exposed to Seneca, another 
                    one of the three most prominent Stoics.
                        
                    What is tragic about Marcus, as one scholar wrote, is how his “philosophy—which is about self-restraint, duty, and respect for
                    others—was so abjectly abandoned by the imperial line he anointed on his death.”
